# Program_ONE-HTML_CSS_1
Take this course for the Oracle ONE Education program - HTML5 and CSS3 part 1: My First Website

Where I learned: 

- To define the basic structure of HTML.
- With the `DOCTYPE` tag, we define which version of HTML we are using.
- The `<html>` tag marks the content to be rendered in the browser. Within this tag, we can define the language of the page, through the `lang` property.
- How to pass the *encoding* information of our page to the browser, through the `<meta>` tag and the `charset` property.
- How to define the title of a page, through the `<title>` tag.
- How to separate the information being passed to the browser, using the `<head>` tag.
- How to separate the content of the page, using the `<body>` tag.
- How to configure the presentation of texts: alignment (`text-align`), font size (`font-size`), background color (`background`) and text color (`color`).
- CSS inline**: add CSS styles in the same line where we have our HTML tag.
- The **`<style>`** tag: inside this tag we can place CSS markup referring to the elements we have in our HTML.
- The presentation of the CSS as an external file.
- How CSS cascading style works.
- How to import an external CSS file into our HTML page.
- How to represent colors in CSS: 1) through the English color name, 2) through its hexadecimal representation and 3) through RGB.
- How to restructure our code, removing the inline CSS styles and placing them in the external CSS file.
- How to create an identifier to specifically mark an element: how to reference that identifier in the CSS.
- How to add an image to our page.
- How to adjust the height of the element, through the `height` property.
- How to adjust the width of the element, through the `width` property.
- How to adjust the internal margin of the element, through the `padding` property.
- How to adjust the external margin of the element, through the `margin` property.
- How a front-end team is normally formed nowadays.
- We got to know lists (ordered and unordered), we worked with unordered lists.
- We saw that for each list item we need to use the `<li>` tag.
- The concept of the classes in the CSS, these serve to mark elements, only that we can replicate the styles in several elements.
- How to reference a class in CSS.
- Content dividers, using the `<div>` tag.
- The `inline` and `block` behaviors.
- The concept of page header and how to create it.
- That it is not recommended to create styles using labels, the ideal is to use class selectors for everything.
